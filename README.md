# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Python
This data analysis project dives into customer churn within a telecommunications company using Python and data analysis techniques. By examining customer demographics, service usage, satisfaction scores, and financial metrics, the project aims to identify factors that contribute to customer churn and develop targeted strategies to retain valuable customers.
## Objective
This project analyzes customer churn data for a fictional California-based telco company with the following goals:<br>
* <b>Understand customer churn:</b> Analyze factors influencing customer churn, such as demographics, service subscriptions, satisfaction levels, and customer lifetime value.
* <b>DIdentify high-risk and high valued customers:</b> Develop a churn prediction model to identify customers at high risk of leaving the company.
* <b>Develop customer retention strategies:</b> Utilize insights from the analysis to recommend targeted marketing campaigns, service bundles, and loyalty programs to retain high-value customers and reduce churn.

## Key Questions
* Are there any demographic segments that are more likely to churn?
* Do customers who subscribe to additional services have a higher churn rate?
* Do customers on different contract lengths (month-to-month, one-year, two-year) have different churn rates?
* Is there a correlation between satisfaction score and churn rate?
* Can we identify key factors that contribute to customer churn using churn score and churn category?
* How can we use CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) to identify high-value customers?
